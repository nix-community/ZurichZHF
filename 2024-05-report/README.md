# Zürich 24.05 ZHF Hackathon

On the last weekend of May 2024, the Zürich Friends of Nix hosted a two-day hackathon around the [Zero Hydra Failures release preparations for NixOS 24.05](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/lets-have-a-great-24-05-release-cycle/43564) at [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.ost.ch/) (OST) right next to Lake Zürich.

# Background and preparations

This is the fourth such event in a row. It's designed to encourage people to get to know each other, hack on everything Nix, and shape the future of open source together.

Since the marketing team's 2024 community survey got delayed and we thus didn't manage to gather broader feedback on the results from the [November 2023 UX workhop](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/zurich-23-11-zhf-hackathon-and-ux-workshop-report/37848), we decided to not to pursue the workshop track this time around. This coincided with [participant feedback](https://github.com/nix-community/developer-workshop/issues/3), which indicated a desire for a more relaxed schedule and more opportunities to mingle and write code.

# Event

The event took place in two large classroom and the hallway connecting them. It spanned Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 to 18:00.

We had 20 attendees on Saturday and 16 on Sunday, once again arriving from all over Europe. We were very happy to welcome first-time participants, regulars such as @gefla @das-g, and Nixpkgs maintainers @infinisil, @roberth, and @imincik who were around to share their expertise.

On Saturday:
- Alex (@ners) welcomed attendees
- Silvan (@infinisil) gave an overview on the [Nix community consitutitonal assembly](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-constitutional-assembly-appointment/45504) that was formed recently
- Valentin (@fricklerhandwerk) summarised the last [18 months of work on Nix documentation](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2024-05-02-right-words-right-place/) and showcased new tutorials and guides on [nix.dev](https://nix.dev)

We then went on to address various issues attendees had brought or dug up, and discussed various technical issues around architecture, documentation, and coding conventions. It definitely helped to have four people with merge permissions in the room, which allowed contributors to get their change proposals reviewed, improved, and merged on the spot.

Following popular demand, on Sunday @ners held an impromptu seminar on setting up Haskell projects with Nix, teaching beginners and refreshing intermediates on basics of purely functional programming.

Over the weekend, the group [created 20](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ANixOS+ZurichZHF+created%3A2024-05-24..2024-05-26&type=pullrequests) and [concluded 15](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ANixOS+ZurichZHF+closed%3A2024-05-24..2024-05-26&type=pullrequests) issues or pull requests, with the event series now totalling at [68 created](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ANixOS+ZurichZHF+created%3A%3C2024-05-26&type=pullrequests) and [48 concluded](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ANixOS+ZurichZHF+closed%3A%3C2024-05-26&type=pullrequests) contributions.

Saturday's hacking was made even more enjoyable with organisers supplying Poke Bowls for lunch. The day ended with a group photo at the lake, and part of the group went on to have dinner together.

On Sunday, Zurich friend of Nix Cazim enchanted everyone with his outdoor Wok cuisine for an extended lunch break in the lake park.
